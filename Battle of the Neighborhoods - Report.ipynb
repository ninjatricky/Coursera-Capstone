            "source": "Manchester is a very multicultural and diverse city in the North of England.  It has many opportunities for young people and is surrounded by many different towns and villages all of which offer a range of lifestyle and personalities.  Due to the close proximity of these areas and a good travel network, it is an ideal place to maintain a work life balance while living in the comfort of a suburb and commuting into the city for work.\\\n\\\nIn the UK, many people relocate to the south east in order to live and work in London for the career opportunities and financial gains.  However, London is a very big area and travel into and across the city is vastly greater in terms of time and cost than travel in the Manchester area.  For this reason, it is important that anyone who relocates to London chooses the right area in which to live, in order to be happy in their local area and minimise the need for travel outside of their commute.\\\n\\\nFor this reason, this project will attempt to find similarities between the neighbourhoods in the Manchester area and those within London area, to provide a guide to anyone seeking to relocate.  Neighbourhoods will be clustered based on the venues within their centres and then a list of mappings between Manchester and London created.  "
